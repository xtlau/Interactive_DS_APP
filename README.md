# HEART: Health Exploration and Analytical Research Tool for Multi-level Prediction Modeling and Behavioral Risk Factor Analysis


Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have profoundly impacted the exploration of population and behavioral health insights by illustrating unseen patterns, making new predictions, and analyzing trends based on
population health data, thanks to advanced algorithms andsubstantial computing power. 

However, the machine learning models constructed from current population health studies are usually restricted to specific diseases or certain
variables. Moreover, for public health researchers without programming expertise, models constructed by programmers are often less interactive, leading to distrust and
reduced acceptance. This issue is exacerbated when the researchers need to communicate modifications to include more factors, reducing research efficiency and hindering the public health research process. 

Health Exploration and Analytical Research Tool (HEART), an interactive data science web application designed to enhance the adoption of machine learning models in public health analysis settings. HEART empowers
public health researchers without programming expertise to perform exploratory data analysis, develop customized machine learning models, conduct factor analysis at population levels, and make corresponding predictions at in-
dividual levels, thereby facilitating multi-level insights. 

By improving user engagement with machine learning models, HEART supports the integration of ML-driven insights into population health analysis processes at multiple levels,
which not only fosters deeper trust in ML technologies among healthcare professionals but also enhances the utilization of these insights for comprehensive public health
surveillance and individualized analysis.
